# GraphView

I'm designing a framework for my Senior Thesis to abstract away the implementation of a network of nodes for the study of distributed algorithms. The goal is to allow a user to easily define how a node behaves, and then launch a network of nodes to visualize the algorithm running.

The project is split into two parts -  the core java application that will launch a system of nodes that communicate with each other, and a webapp that will allow the user to easily configure the entire system and compare the results of different runs.

This is the repository for the webapp, the source code for the java application can be found here - https://github.com/speter52/GraphSim
